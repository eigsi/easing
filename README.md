# EASING
EASING is a Desktop Application that allows you to create front-end animations in an intuitive way. With its graphical interface, real-time preview, and JSON export functionality, EASING makes it easy to integrate advanced animations into your code using a dedicated JavaScript/TypeScript library.

- **Animation Editor** : Create and fine-tune animations with a graph-based interface and keyframe editor.
